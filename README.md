# United-States-Airlines-Analysis

DESCRIPTION

According to air travel consumer reports, a large proportion of consumer complaints are about frequent flight delays.

Out of all the complaints received from consumers about airline services, 32% were related to cancellations, delays, or other deviations from the airlinesâ€™ schedules.

There are unavoidable delays that can be caused by air traffic, no passengers at the airport, weather conditions, mechanical issues, passengers coming from delayed connecting flights, security clearance, and aircraft preparation.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to identify the factors that contribute to avoidable flight delays. You are also required to build a model to predict if the flight will be delayed.
